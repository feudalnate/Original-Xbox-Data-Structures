Some info I [posted on Reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828041258/https://old.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/comments/hugrqi/hard_drive_config_area/) at some point. This is the layout of the first 64 sectors (0x800 bytes) of a Xbox hard disk

|Sector Index (ranges are inclusive)|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|0|Boot sector (unused - on retail anyway, labeled as boot sector in kernel)|
|1-2|Reserved(?) (my best guess is that the first 3 sectors are just legacy boot/MBR/BIOS/etc.  sectors that they 0xFF'd out from when they converted the FAT32 structure to FATX for use with the xbox (e.g.: sectors that matter on computers but not xbox)|
|3|Refurb. information (power cycle count, timestamp when first powered on after factory - not much else)|
|4-7|Cache database (a map to what's cached on X/Y/Z partitions? or just titles played on the console in general)|
|\----CONFIG START----||
|8-15|Config. sectors (first sector is config. data (sector 8))|
|9|Machine account sector (machine info (mac, sn, etc.) packed into xbl account struct., identifying data sent to xbl for blacklist check/console database caching)|
|10|User settings sector 1 (holds certain user specified settings, favored over writing EEPROM for certain things)|
|11|User settings sector 2|
|\----CONFIG END----||
|12-19|XBL account sectors (1 account per sector)|
|20-63|Unused/reserved (likely padding for cluster alignment of partitions)|
|64-...|Partitions start|
